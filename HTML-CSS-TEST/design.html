        and the subjects I learned were current,

        "I was an EMT for many years before 
        I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking 
        to make a transition and have heard some 
        people who had an amazing experience here. 
        I signed up for the free intro course and 
        found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly 
        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best—and 
        most grueling—time of my life."
